# Image Classification

Python program for testing and comparing the performance of three of the most popular image feature extraction techniques:
<br>
- SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
- SURF (Speeded up robust features)
- HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)

The program firstly extracts the features of the images using all 3 techniques and then trains a **Random Forest Classifier** and a **2-layer sigmoid** and then compares the accuracy of all of them.

The DataSet used in this project is taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansanagapati/images-dataset" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>
